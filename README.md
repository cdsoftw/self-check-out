# SelfCheckOut

This repo contains the source code and project files for a graphical user interface built from scratch using the JavaX Swing library in NetBeans by myself and 5 other students. The system had a database of products, prices, and employees maintained on a MySQL server and included functionality such as (simulated) multiple payment methods, changing prices, adding and removing items, adding and removing employees, checking for age-required items, etc. I was responsible for the employee functionality (changing the database, checking ages, etc.), which included management of JLists, JFields, SQL queries, etc. Unfortunately, it is no longer operational due to the MySQL database it was built around no longer being active. Published for reference only.
